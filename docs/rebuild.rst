The piw-rebuild script is used to inject rebuild requests for various web
pages into the piwheels system. This script must be run on the same node as
the :doc:`piw-master <master>` service.

Usage
=====

This utility is used to request rebuilds of parts of the piwheels website. This
is primarily useful after manual fixes to the database, manipulation of the
file-system, or after large-scale upgrades which require rebuilding many pages.

The mandatory *part* parameter can be one of the following values, which
specify which part of the website to rebuild:

+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Part    | Description                                             |
+=========+=========================================================+
| home    | Rebuild the home-page (/index.html)                     |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| search  | Rebuild the JSON search-index (/packages.json)          |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| project | Rebuild the project-page for the specified package      |
|         | (/project/*package*/index.html)                         |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| index   | Rebuild the simple-index *and* the project-page         |
|         | for the specified package (/simple/*package*/index.html |
|         | *and* /project/*package*/index.html)                    |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+

If *part* is "project" or "index" you may optionally specify a *package* name
for which to rebuild the specified part. If the *package* name is omitted, the
utility will request a rebuild of the specified part for **all** known packages
in the system.

.. warning::

    In the case a rebuild of **all** packages is requested, you will be
    prompted to make sure you wish to continue (this option can take hours to
    process on a system with many builds). The :option:`--yes` option can be
    used to skip this prompt but should be used carefully!

Note that the utility only requests the rebuild of the specified part. This
request will be queued, and acted upon as soon as :ref:`the-scribe` reaches it
but there is no guarantee this has occurred by the time the utility exits. The
return code will be 0 if the rebuild request was queued successfully. If
anything fails the return code will be non-zero and the request may or may not
have been queued.

The utility should only ever be run directly on the master node (opening the
import queue to other machines is a potential security risk).
