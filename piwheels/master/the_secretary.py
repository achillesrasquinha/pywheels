    This task buffers requests for the scribe, for the purpose of consolidating
    multiple consecutive (duplicate) requests.

    Requests to write the project page for a package (which is a relatively
    expensive operation in terms of database accesses) can come in thick and
    fast, particularly when a new version is being registered with lots of
    files. There's little point in writing the project page 5 times in as many
    seconds, or writing the project page, then the index and project page
    immediately afterward. This class is used to buffer requests for up to a
    minute, allowing us to eliminate many of the duplicate requests.

        these are either sufficiently rare ("HOME", "SEARCH") that no benefit

        and fast in the case of multiple file registrations picked up by
        :class:`CloudGazer`. In this case, requests are buffered for a minute

        project page for package "foo" within that period, they will be
        combined into a single request. After the minute of buffering, the
